Overriding:
---------

Method Overriding:-
------------------
If two classes have same method name , same return type , same number of parameters , same type of parameters and same order   and If they have IS-A relation ship between we call as Method Overriding.

Example:
--------
          A 
          m1()
          B   extends A
          m1()


If we are not satisfied with parent class implementation and we we want to redefine the body  we have redefine in the child class

Rule:
 By following same method name, same return type and same no of parameters. same type and order of parametrs and they should have IS -A Relation ship.

 public class A {
	 public int speed(String bike) {
		 return 50;
	 }
}

public class B extends A {
     
	@Override
	public int speed(String bike) {
     return 100;
	}

}

public class App {
	public static void main(String[] args) {
		A a = new B();
		int speed = a.speed("Pulsar");
		System.out.println("Speed is :"+speed);
	}
}

public class A {


	 public int minSpeed() {
		 return 50;
	 }
	 
	 public int maxSpeed() {
		 return 100;
	 }
}



public class B extends A {



	@Override
	public int maxSpeed() {
		return 150;
	}

}
public class App {


	public static void main(String[] args) {

		A a = new B();
		int mimspeed = a.minSpeed();
		int maxspeed = a.maxSpeed();
		System.out.println(mimspeed);
		System.out.println(maxspeed);
	}
}
